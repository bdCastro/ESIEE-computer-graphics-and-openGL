# TP 1: Hello World

## 1. Objetive

The objective of this TP is to create a simple program in C that prints "Hello World" on the screen using OpenGL.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Software

#### GLFW

GLFW is a library that allows the creation of windows, OpenGL contexts and the handling of input and events. It is available for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X and is licensed under the zlib/libpng license.

For macOS, GLFW is available through Homebrew:

```bash
brew install glfw
```

## 3. Seting up Visual Studio Code

### 3.1 Install the C/C++ extension

The C/C++ extension adds language support for C/C++ to Visual Studio Code, including features such as IntelliSense and debugging.

### 3.2 Cofiguration files

The tasks.json file is used to build and run the program. It is located in the .vscode folder.

Following this YouTube video [link](https://youtu.be/7-dL6a5_B3I?si=H1uGXRxoTELzBd2d), configure the tasks.json file, and the dependencies folder.
